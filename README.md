My management of my favorite steam skin. Simple layout and style. 
Oiginally made by -Inhibitor all style and function are by them. I am just maintaing this as they quit doing so as of SEP 17, 2019. Orignally taken from: https://github.com/airforsteam/Air-for-Steam/

02/26/2021 - NOTE: Retiring this "as-is" for now as Valve has made Steam really hard for skins to be updated due to friends list and the main nav. At the moment the main nav does not show up.
